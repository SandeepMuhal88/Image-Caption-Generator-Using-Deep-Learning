# Image Caption Generator
Make project using Transfer learning we use VGG16 model for pre tained model use for next layer we use Filcker8k image datasets

```
import tensorflow 
import os
import pickle
import numpy as np
# %pip install tqdm
from tqdm import tqdm

```
Use these library to import and tqdm is show loading simble so use that library
tqdm:-progress bar dikhane ke liye (sirf cosmetic, processing speed pe koi effect nahi).

### Important library 
``` 
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16, preprocess_input
from keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array
````
load_img that is method to load image load_img â†’ PIL Image object deta hai.

## Download latest version
i am use the Kaggle Datasets use use line of code not dowload the datasets useing kaggle account and APIs
```
import kagglehub
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("adityajn105/flickr8k")

print("Path to dataset files:", path)
```
### Make Model use VGG16

```
#load Model
model = VGG16()
#Restructure the model
model = Model(inputs=model.inputs, outputs=model.layers[-2].output)
#summarize the model
model.summary()
```
This is a Convolutional Neural Network which is pre-trained on ImageNet dataset (1.2M images, 1000 classes).

By default, VGG16() gives you the complete model (input â†’ convolutional blocks â†’ fully connected layers â†’ final 1000 class softmax output).
ðŸ‘‰ Here you cut the original VGG16 model.
```
model.layers[-2] means second last layer.
```
The last layer of VGG16 is: Dense(1000, activation='softmax') â†’ which predicts 1000 classes of ImageNet.

It has a first layer: Dense(4096, activation='relu') â†’ a feature representation layer.

So you said:

"I don't want the final classification, I want the features that are generated just before the last softmax."

Result â†’ now the model will take the input image and output a 4096-dimensional feature vector, not 1000 classes of ImageNet.

This will print the Structure of the model.You See:

Input:(244,244,3) (image size for VGG16).

Output:(4096,)(features vector)
